# Fluid Dynamics Simulation

> [!NOTE]
> Not much has been implemented so far, and you can only see a visualisation of simple wave functions rather than a full fluid dynamics simulation.

This project is written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and uses the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library for rendering.
